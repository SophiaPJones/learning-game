# Common Lisp Project Template

This is my template project for Common Lisp applications.

The project includes my preferred libraries for day-by-day tasks and scripts to
run the tests and build a standalone executable (SBCL).

## Usage

### New Project

1. Clone this repository
2. Run (replace `my-cl-project` by the name of your new project)

```bash
./cl-project-template/rename.sh my-cl-project
```

### Run Tests

```bash
make check
```

### Build Executable

```bash
make
```
